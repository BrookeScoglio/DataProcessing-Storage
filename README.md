# Assignment Modification for Official Use
## To make this assignment suitable for official use in the future, the following modifications could be considered:
1. Testing Guidelines: Define clear guidelines for testing, including the expected outcomes for different test cases. Encouraging students to write comprehensive test suites will ensure the reliability and correctness of their implementations.
Code Structure Standards: Define standards for code structure, commenting, and documentation to promote readability and maintainability. Providing code templates or style guides can help students adhere to best practices.
3. Grading Rubric: Develop a detailed grading rubric covering various aspects such as functionality, code quality, error handling, and adherence to guidelines. Clearly communicate the criteria and weightage for each aspect to students to ensure fairness and transparency in grading.

By incorporating these modifications, the assignment would provide a more structured learning experience, facilitate clearer communication of expectations, and enable more effective assessment of student submissions.
